It offers a seamless way to discover comprehensive definitions and context for various words, enriching your vocabulary and understanding.

**Why This Extension?**
I chose to develop ZooOfWords to provide users in enhancing their language skills. 
Understanding the importance of vocabulary building, I wanted to create an accessible and user-friendly solution that enables effortless exploration of the rich world of words.
Even though this extension does not work directly on making an existing webpage better, I went a little way out to make a universal usable extension
